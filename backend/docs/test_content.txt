Machine Learning Study Guide

What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. 
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, 
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
